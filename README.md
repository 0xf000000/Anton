Anton a small java program that reads messages from the client and prints it to the Server.

# How to Use Him in a Terminal ðŸ‘¾

I uploadet client and server in the same package for people to look at the Code. If you wanna try it out on your commandline just take the two java files
move them to a seperate location and compile the two files with the terminal command.

```bash
javac "YourFile"

```

IMPORTANT -> remove the package declaration at the start of the javafile
otherwise the Jvm while search the main method in a package that doesnt exist. 
you can execute then the .class files that are compiled with 

```bash
java "thefileyouwanttoexecute"

```
Remember that the CLient needs to parameters ipadress and port.
